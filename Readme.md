## by Hao Jiang Bai
 

## Dataset

> The Dataset contains 113,917 loans, each loan has information on each borrower's annual percentage rate (APR), status, borrowed amount, debt, etc. Variables with missing values were dropped to make the Dataset more accurate. Outliers were also removed to provide more reliable Data.
This investigation will be analyzing factors that could influence borrower's APR and what loans were taken by what type of borrowers.

## Summary of Findings

> After analyzing each variables. Borrowers's APR, Borrowers's score, rating, available bank card credit and creditscore were found to be negatively correlated to Borrower's APR. Adding that that, borrower' Scores (given from 0 to 11) gave the strongest negative relationship with borrower's APR.

> Borrowers with different letter ratings were also analyzed. It came out that borrowers with the lowerest rating(HR) received higher APR percentage, and borrower with high rating A(A) received lowers APR percentage. This differentiate groups of people in terms of APR received based on their rating and scores.

 

## Key Insights for Presentation

> First, histogram plot were created to visualize the distribution on borrower's APR percentage.  After exploring all possible variables related to BorrowerAPR. ProsperScore has the strongest relationship with Borrower's APR (negatively correlated). Scatter plot and Heatmap were also created to find out that ProsperScore and BorrowerAPR were negatively correlated. The third plot created multiple scatter plots (BorrowerAPR vs ProsperScore) on different letter ratings. The plots showed the lowerest rating(HR) of borrowers received the highest APR percentage, and borrowers with highest rating (AA) received the lowerst APR percentage.
